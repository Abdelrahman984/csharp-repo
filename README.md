## C# Basics

> [!NOTE]
> This assumes that you already have a basic understanding. It focuses on the differences between C# and other languages and highlights some syntaxes.

### DataTypes

C# uses the same data types as C++ and Python, but it is a statically typed language, unlike dynamically typed languages. C# introduces two additional data types compared to C++:

1. `var`: This data type automatically detects the data type.
2. `decimal`: This data type is similar to `float`, but it offers higher precision with 28-29 significant digits and a size of 128 bits (16 bytes), whereas `float` is only 32 bits (4 bytes) in size. When defining a `decimal` value, you should append `m` after the number, while for `float`, you should append `f`.

All other datatypes are the same as C++.
